# udel_courses
I graduated in Spring 2022 with Cum Laude with a BS in Chemical Engineering and minors in Business Administration, Chemistry, and Economics from University of Delaware. This repo is intended to help the current chemical engineering students with their projects/labs that are mostly coding-based. Hopefully these helps with your courses.
