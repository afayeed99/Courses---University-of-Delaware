# udel_courses
I graduated in Spring 2022 with Cum Laude with a BS in Chemical Engineering and minors in Business Administration, Chemistry, and Economics from University of Delaware. This repo is intended to help the current chemical engineering students with their projects/labs that are mostly coding-based. Hopefully these helps with your courses.

FYI, I took CHEG473 - Chemical Engineering Project 1 as a replacement to CHEG445 - Chemical Engineering Laboratory II, so I do not have any materials for CHEG445.
