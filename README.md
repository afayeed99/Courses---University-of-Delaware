I graduated Cum Laude in Spring 2022, earning a BS in Chemical Engineering and minors in Business Administration, Chemistry, and Economics from the University of Delaware. This repository is a resource designed to assist current chemical engineering students with their coding-based projects and labs. While you are welcome to use these resources, I recommend using them as a source of inspiration rather than duplicating them verbatim. It is essential not to replicate my code directly; instead, use it as a foundation to understand and develop your own solutions.

By the way, I opted for CHEG473 - Chemical Engineering Project 1 in lieu of CHEG445 - Chemical Engineering Laboratory II, which is why I do not have materials for CHEG445.
